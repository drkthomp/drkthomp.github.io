      title: 'ðŸ§¬ Bioinformatics & Data Visualization'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        I'm a Master's student in Bioinformatics at the University of Copenhagen, with a focus on genomic data, machine learning, and visual storytelling.

        My work bridges science and design: I build reproducible pipelines, run in-depth analyses, and craft visualizations that help make complex biological data understandable and impactful. I work primarily in R, Python, and Snakemake.

        While I remain committed to research and open science, I'm also building a career in freelance data visualization and scientific communication. If you're looking for someone who can make your data clear, compelling, and scientifically groundedâ€”I'd love to hear from you.
