TLDR: It is shown that mapped, exonic, non-duplicate (MEND) reads are a useful measure of reproducibility of RNA-Seq datasets used for gene expression analysis, and recommended that all RNA- Seq gene expression experiments, sensitivity studies, and depth recommendations use MEND units for sequencing depth.},
