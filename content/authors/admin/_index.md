## About Me

I'm Drew Thompson—a data visualization fanatic with a background in bioinformatics, passionate about turning complex datasets into actionable insights. I specialize in genomic data and love building reproducible pipelines that tell clear, visual stories. When I'm not coding or charting, you can find me caring for my guinea pigs or sketching infographic ideas. I’m currently completing my Master's thesis on non-linear polygenic risk score modeling and am available for freelance data visualization and R/Python analytics work.
