TLDR: It is shown that mapped, exonic, non-duplicate (MEND) reads are a useful measure of reproducibility of RNA-Seq datasets used for gene expression analysis, and recommended that all RNA- Seq gene expression experiments, sensitivity studies, and depth recommendations use MEND units for sequencing depth.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Epitopes are peptides that present on the surface of the cell and can be recognized by immune cells to initiate the immune response. Identification of neoepitopes -- tumor-specific, MHC-bound epitopes recognized specifically by T-cells -- is valuable for predicting response to immunotherapies, including checkpoint blockade therapies. Tumors with more neoepitopes tend to be more responsive to immune checkpoint therapies compared to tumors with fewer neoepitopes. ProTECT is a previously published computational method that uses Illumina whole genome and transcriptome sequencing data from tumor and matched normal tissues to identify neoepitopes. Tumor and normal whole genome sequencing data are used to infer a patient's HLA haplotypes, as well as annotate variants as either somatic or germline. While whole genome sequencing is comprehensive, it is quite costly and not available for many samples. Here we adapt ProTECT to use only tumor RNA sequencing data and HLA haplotype information available to the clinician to identify neoepitopes in a tumor sample. Prior to running ProTECT, we use the computational tools Opossum and Platypus for variant calling instead of Radia (which is designed for variant calling using both RNA and DNA sequencing data as input). To determine which variants are somatic and therefore could represent tumor neoepitopes, variants found in RNA are compared to a panel of normals, for example the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD; containing variants from 125,748 exome sequences and 15,708 whole-genome sequences). With the resulting somatic variants and the HLA type, ProTECT proceeds as usual, with translation of variants into proteins, MHC:Peptide binding predictions and neoepitope ranking. We find that high quality neoepitopes are identifiable using an RNA-only approach, when genomic data is absent. Future work will validate the sensitivity of our method by benchmarking it against the original ProTECT predictions in the TCGA Prostate Adenocarcinoma cohort.

  abstract = {Abstract             With the low incidence of mutations in pediatric cancers, alternate genomic approaches are needed to identify therapeutic targets. Our study, the Comparative Analysis of RNA Expression to Improve Pediatric and Young Adult Cancer Treatment, was conducted by the UC Santa Cruz Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative and Stanford University School of Medicine. RNA sequencing data from 33 children and young adults with a relapsed, refractory or rare cancer underwent CARE analysis to reveal activated cancer driver pathways and nominate treatments. We compare our pipeline to other gene expression outlier detection approaches and discuss challenges for clinical implementation. Of our 33 patients, 31 (94\%) had findings of potential clinical significance. Findings were implemented in 5 patients, 3 of which had defined clinical benefit. We demonstrate that comparator cohort composition determines which outliers are detected. This study highlights the clinical utility and challenges of implementing comparative RNA sequencing analysis in the clinic.},
